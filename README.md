## **Restaurant Reservation System**

This is a simple command-line based restaurant reservation system that allows managing tables, customers, and reservations in a scalable and interactive way. The system is designed to simulate the backend logic of a restaurantâ€™s reservation workflow, including support for multiple tables and customer management.

### Features

* View all reservations
* Filter reservations by date or customer
* View individual reservation details
* Create new reservations (manual or randomly generated)
* Update existing reservations
* Delete reservations
* List all clients and tables

### How it Works

The ReservationSystem class (defined in project.py) manages the internal state of the system, including customers, reservations, and tables. The main.py script offers a text-based menu interface for interacting with the system.

When making a reservation, the system:

1. Assigns one or more available tables to fit the party size
2. Ensures no double-booking of tables
3. Generates unique customer and reservation IDs
